  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>An authentic Korean bibimbap, a vibrant and wholesome dish bursting with flavors. Complete with a bibimbap sauce that's so good, you’ll want to drizzle it on everything!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>100 g ground beef (or thinly sliced beef)</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp brown sugar</li>
    <li>¼ tsp minced garlic (for beef)</li>
    <li>250 g cooked spinach (or fresh spinach, blanched)</li>
    <li>350 g bean sprouts (cooked or blanched)</li>
    <li>100 g shiitake mushrooms (sliced)</li>
    <li>120 g carrots (julienned)</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste (for veggies)</li>
    <li>3 to 4 servings of steamed rice</li>
    <li>3 or 4 eggs (optional — fried or sunny‑side‑up)</li>
    <li>Seasoned seaweed (shredded), for topping (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>For the Bibimbap Sauce</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 Tbsp Gochujang</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp sugar (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tsp vinegar (like rice or apple vinegar) — optional</li>
    <li>1 tsp minced garlic — optional</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix ground beef with soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, and ¼ tsp minced garlic. Let it marinate ~30 min (if you have time).</li>
    <li>Heat a bit of oil in a pan or wok over medium‑high heat and cook the beef until browned and done (about 3‑5 minutes). Remove and set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare vegetables: cook or blanch spinach and bean sprouts (or prepare per your preference). Sauté carrots and sliced mushrooms separately (with a little oil and salt) until tender.</li>
    <li>Prepare sauce: in a bowl, mix gochujang, sesame oil, sugar, water, optional sesame seeds/vinegar/garlic until smooth.</li>
    <li>Fry eggs (one per serving) — sunny‑side‑up or preferred style.</li>
    <li>Assemble: put steamed rice into bowls, top with beef, cooked vegetables (spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms), then place egg on top. Add shredded seaweed if using. Drizzle with bibimbap sauce (or serve the sauce on the side if you like).</li>
    <li>Before eating, mix everything thoroughly so rice, veggies, beef, egg, and sauce combine — that’s the whole point of bibimbap! Enjoy immediately.</li>
