  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Want to eat like a fighter? Ripred the rat's favorite food is now easy for YOU to make! Taste the delicious goodness of this shrimp in cream sauce.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 pound raw shrimp — peeled and deveined</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt (or ¼ teaspoon regular salt), divided</li>
    <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley (or 1 teaspoon dried parsley)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium‑high heat. Season the shrimp with half the salt and pepper. Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook until just cooked through — about 4 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a plate, cover with foil, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic to the <em>same</em> skillet. Sauté for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium‑low. Add the heavy cream, cayenne pepper (if using), and the remaining salt and pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring continuously (about 1 minute).</li>
    <li>Add the grated Parmesan cheese and stir gently until it melts and the sauce becomes smooth (about 30 seconds).</li>
    <li>Add the shrimp back to the skillet. Gently stir to coat them with the sauce and reheat — about 1 more minute. Do <em>not</em> overcook the shrimp.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle chopped parsley on top. Serve immediately — ideally over pasta or rice.</li>
  </ol>
